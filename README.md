# MDIA-1620
A cool repository for my MIDA 1620 code
My name is Jiajun Li, preferred to be called Volta. *Volta* is taken by my online nickname *S_Volta_tori*. "S" is "5" and *Satori* actually is Komeji Satori, my favourite character in *Touhou Project*.

My favourite sandwich is bacon lettuce with grilled cheese...Actually it's the one that is on sale in bakery shops in Guilin, China...
